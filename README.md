# Worms vs Birds
A stab at producing a game over a limited amount of time, following some self-imposed rules to mimic the limitations of a GameBoy. https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5

RULES:

The aim of GBJam is to create a GameBoy themed game

 - All assets must be created during the duration of the Jam
 - Keep in the original GameBoy screen resolution of 160px x 144px
 - Use only 4 colors in your game
 - Worms Vs Birds:

A Plants Vs. Zombies type game where you will tend a garden of bushes and worms and defend against incoming birds.

Controls:

- The digital pad (Arrow keys) to move the cursor
- B to enter the selection menu
- A to place objects
- C to zoom closer to the GameBoy screen.
- Q to quit.
- Esc to pause

How to play:

Plase bushes to secure long-term currency generation. Move the cursor over your fully grown bushes to collect currency. Your goal is to ensure no bird reaches the end of any lane. If they do, you lose. If the time runs out and you defeat the remaining birds, you win.

Place defender worms to shoot down birds before they reach the end of your lane.

Escape restarts the game when you are in a win/lose menu.

The buttons on the gameboy are also fully functional to play the game (use the mouse to click).

A counter at the top displays your currency, and a timer to the right of it displays the time remaining and the current wave.

About the units:

There are two types of player units, a bush to generate currency, and a worm to protect the lane. There will be one kind of bird, randomly traversing a lane depending on the time progression and the current wave.
