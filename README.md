# Worms vs Birds
A stab at producing a game over a limited amount of time, following some self-imposed rules to mimic the limitations of a GameBoy. https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5

RULES:

  - The aim of GBJam is to create a GameBoy themed game
  - All assets must be created during the duration of the Jam
  - Keep in the original GameBoy screen resolution of 160px x 144px
  - Use only 4 colors in your game


Theme:

The finished game will be a Plants Vs. Zombies type game where you will tend a garden using the digital pad, press B to bring up a selection menu, and A to place objects.

The theme itself will be "Worms Vs. Birds".

There will (if I have time) be two types of worms, one to generate currency, and one to protect the lane.
There will be one kind of bird, randomly traversing a lane depending on the time progression

There will probably be some kind of time counter, currency counter, maybe tiny health bars for the worms and zombies (if I have time)

Hopefully sound and music as well ;)

Time to strap down and get some work done.

PS. I'll probably end up making the entire thing run in a virtual gameboy (looks, not hardware).
